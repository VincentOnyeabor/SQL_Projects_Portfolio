In this project, I demonstrated my SQL skills by creating and managing a friends table in an SQLite database. I implemented various SQL operations including:

Creating a table structure
Inserting data into the table
Querying the data
Modifying the table structure
Updating existing data
Deleting rows from the table
This hands-on experience allowed me to practice essential SQL commands and gain practical knowledge in database manipulation.
